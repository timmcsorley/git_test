        <p>It was a time of darkness for the Simmons family. The family was gathered around the father, Gerald Simmons. Holding Gerald's right hand was his wife Sheila, to whom he was married for the past forty-five years. She knew that the Simmons family wouldn't have gone to all of the places they had without her husband's adventurous spirit.</p>
        <p>"I see a light! A light at the end of the tunnel!" Gerald said, letting go of his wife's hand and pointing forward. The family looked where he was pointing, gasped, and then were hit by the subway train.</p>
